# Test-driven development exercises #

### Welcome! ###
The aim of this repository is to provide exercises for TDD practice. Of course, contributions are more than welcomed, so feel free to send pull requests as you see fit.

### What's in store for you? ###
As this is a young repository, there's still not too much to offer. Here's a brief list of what we have:

* [Invoice generator](https://github.com/cristianrasch/tdd/tree/master/invoice_gen): simple CLI invoice generator that bills phone usage, i.e. local, national and international calls.

* Some [math exercises](https://github.com/cristianrasch/tdd/tree/master/math): trivial math functions implemented following a test-first approach.
